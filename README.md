# devops_task8: Run a Simple Java Maven Build Job in Jenkins

By Guru Sahib Ji's grace tried to solve this task by running jenkins through docker container on localhost using command: docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:lts

then creating a build job, configuring it adding git repository, maven tool, applying "Invoke top-level Maven targets" under build steps, later tried for build which was successful after some failure, got help from links added in reference file, screenshots related to task was added.
thanks
